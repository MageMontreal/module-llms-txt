/**
 * Content provider SPI for the llms.txt / llms-full.txt / JSONL pipelines.
 *
 * Implementations contribute a section (or set of records) to the generated file.
 * Providers run in the order declared in di.xml inside a frontend-emulated store
 * scope; one failing provider does NOT abort the generation — the abstract
 * generator catches exceptions per-provider and logs them.
 *
 * <b>BREAKING CHANGE in 3.0.0:</b> {@see provide()} now returns an iterable of
 * strings (typically a PHP generator yielding chunks) instead of a single
 * concatenated string. This lets the generator stream output to disk one chunk
 * at a time, keeping memory bounded regardless of catalog size.
 *
 * Recommended chunk granularity:
 *   - markdown providers: yield one header chunk, then one chunk per line
 *   - JSONL providers:    yield one chunk per JSON record (terminated with "\n")
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT accumulate the full output in an array and return it as
 * a single string — that would defeat the streaming design.
